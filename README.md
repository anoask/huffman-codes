# huffman-codes
Implementation of a Huffman Tree in C++, a data structure used for efficient data compression and decompression based on the frequency of characters in the input data. 

Header Files: HuffmanTree.hpp, HuffmanBase.hpp.

HuffmanNode Class

HuffmanTree Class: Construction and Destruction, Building the Tree (buildTree()), Building the Code Table (buildCodeTable()), Compression (compress()), Tree Serialization (serializeTree() and serializeTreeHelper()), Decompression (decompress()).

Decompression process: Deserialize, Decode.
